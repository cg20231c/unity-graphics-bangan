## Introduction to Lighting and Rendering
Lighting and rendering are crucial aspects of creating realistic and visually appealing 3D environments in Unity. They play a significant role in shaping the game or application looks and feels. Let's breakdown the concepts of lighting and rendering :

### Lighting
#### Light Sources
Lighting in Unity is driven by various light sources. These sources can be directional (ex: sunlight), point lights (ex: lightbulb), spotlights, or area lights. Each type of light source affects the scene differently

#### Light Properties
Light have properties such as color, intensity, range, and shadow settings. Adjusting these properties helps to achieve the desired visual atmosphere and mood in the scene

#### Shadows 
Proper shadow casting and receiving are essential for realism. Unity supports various shadow techniques, including shadow mapping and ray tracing

### Rendering
#### Rendering Pipeline
Unity uses a rendering pipeline to process and display 3D graphics. Unity offers several rendering pipelinse, including the Built-in Render Pipeline and the High Definition Render Pipeline

#### Materials and Shaders
Materials define how an object responds to light. Shaders are used to create complex materials by defining how the interact with light and shadows
