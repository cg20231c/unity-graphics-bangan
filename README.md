## Introduction to Lighting and Rendering
Lighting and rendering are crucial aspects of creating realistic and visually appealing 3D environments in Unity. They play a significant role in shaping the game or application looks and feels. Let's breakdown the concepts of lighting and rendering :

1. Lighting
a. Light Sources
Lighting in Unity is driven by various light sources. These sources can be directional (ex: sunlight), point lights (ex: lightbulb), spotlights, or area lights. Each type of light source affects the scene differently

b. Light Properties
Light have properties such as color, intensity, range, and shadow settings. Adjusting these properties helps to achieve the desired visual atmosphere and mood in the scene

c. Shadows 
Proper shadow casting and receiving are essential for realism. Unity supports various shadow techniques, including shadow mapping and ray tracing

2. Rendering
a. Rendering Pipeline
Unity uses a rendering pipeline to process and display 3D graphics. Unity offers several rendering pipelinse, including the Built-in Render Pipeline and the High Definition Render Pipeline

b. Materials and Shaders
Materials define how an object responds to light. Shaders are used to create complex materials by defining how the interact with light and shadows
